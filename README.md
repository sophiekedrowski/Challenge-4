Making a coding quiz using html, css and javascript

## Description
For this project we created a quiz using html, javascript and css. I found this assingment especially challenging and started over in the middle. I learned one of the best ways to make multiple components appear and dissapear was making two html pages and two js pages thanks to another github project I was able to learn from online. This quiz has some bugs I haven't been able to fix yet and unsure if ill have time between now and when it is due.
