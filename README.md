Making a coding quiz using html, css and javascript

## Description
For this project we created a quiz using html, javascript and css. I found this assingment especially challenging and started over in the middle.  This quiz has some bugs I haven't been able to fix yet and unsure if ill have time between now and when it is due. I did enjoy the process of writing a lot more code than we had prior.
